### eCommerce Platform Integrations
To get as many merchants accepting payments on Solana as possible we need to provide easy ways to set up Solana Pay on all eCommerce platforms.

Solana Labs has started a reference implementation for Shopify which you can see here to get a sense of how this might work.

Here are some of the top eCommerce platforms that we're looking to integrate to:

* WooCommerce
* Magento
* BigCommerce
* Wix
* Squarespace

### Other possible projects
* Mobile SDKs
* Checkout UX Components
